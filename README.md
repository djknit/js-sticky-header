## Project Goals and Features
* A simple JavaScript solution to the fixed header problem
* Results in a fixed header that occupies space in the document and on the page as if it were static.

## Instructions for Use
* Import the file `headerScript.js`, or copy the code and include it on the page.
* This script uses jQuery, so ensure that jQuery is included prior to this script's code in the document.
* Attach the class `djknit-sticky-header` to the header element.
* Insert a `<div>` with class `djknit-sticky-head-spacer` directly before the main content of the page.
    * (`<div class="djknit-sticky-head-spacer"></div>`)
* That's it!
